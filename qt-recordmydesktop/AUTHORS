The icons media-playback-pause.svg, media-playback-stop.svg and
media-record.svg, in the src/ directory, are part of the Oxygen
project and are licenced under the GNU-LGPL version 3 or (at your option) 
any later version.  
( The icons have been copied and uncompressed, at 22/11/2008 from 
http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdebase/runtime/pics/oxygen/scalable/actions/ 
where they existed in a compressed form, under the same names but with svgz 
extensions )

Author information about these exists in COPYING.icons.
