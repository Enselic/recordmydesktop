.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
        recordMyDesktop produces a file(default out.ogv) that contains a video and audio recording
.br
of a linux desktop session. The default behavior of recording is to mark areas that have changed(through libxdamage)
.br
and update the frame. This behavior can be changed (option
.B
\-\-full\-shots
) to produce a more accurate result
.br
or capture windows that do not generate events on change(windows with accelerated 3d context)
.br
but this will notably increase the workload.
.br
recordMyDesktop doesn't have a commandline interface.
.br
After startup, it can be controled only through the following signals:
.br
.br
.B
SIGUSR1
causes the program to pause if it's currently recording, and vice-versa.
.br
.B
SIGTERM
causes normal termination of the recording.
.br
.B
SIGINT
also causes normal termination.
.br
.B
SIGABRT
terminates the program and removes the specified output file.
.br
.br
This signals can also be delivered on the application, with the use of 
shortcuts.
.br
See 
.B
\-\-pause\-shortcut
and
.B
\-\-stop\-shortcut
, on the 
.B
Misc.
section
of 
.B
Options
bellow.
.br
 
.br
 
.br
 
A typical scenario of recording can be a command as simple as:
.br
.B
~$ recordmydesktop
.br
which will produce a fullscreen recording named out.ogv
.br
while a command like:
.br
.B
~$ recordmydesktop foo.ogv
.br
will write output to foo.ogv
.br
.br
Since version 0.3, encoding will happen right after the recording finishes.
.br
While this behavior saves a lot of CPU, you can revert to the old one by entering the \-\-on\-the\-fly\-encoding switch.
.br
.br
To specify a region for recording you can type this:
.br
.B
~$ recordmydesktop \-x X_pos \-y Y_pos \-\-width WIDTH \-\-height HEIGHT \-o foo.ogv
.br
where X_pos and Y_pos specify the offset in pixels from the upper left
.br
corner of your screen and WIDTH and HEIGHT the size of the window to be recorded(again in pixels).
.br
If the area extends beyond your current resolution, you will be notified appropriately and nothing will happen.
.br
Notice also, that if any option is entered you have to specify the output file with the \-o switch.
.br
If you try to save under a filename that already exists, the name will be post-fixed with a number (incremented if that name exists already)
.br
.br
.B
To normally end a recording you can press ctl-c.
.br
(which will send a
.B
SIGINT
to the program).
.br

Misc Options:
.br
.TP
.B
    \-\-rescue path_to_data   
    Encode cache data from a previous session, into an Ogg/Theora+Vorbis
    file. The filename will be the one that was chosen initially.
    Any other option specified with this one will be implicitly ignored
    and recordMyDesktop will exit after the end of the encoding.
    This option was added in recordMyDesktop 0.3.7 and it will not
    work with cache files produced from earlier versions.
    When using this option, remember that recordMyDesktop's cache is 
    not safe, in respect to type-sizes and endianness.
.br
.TP
.B
    \-\-print\-config
    Print compilation time options. Currently prints whether Jack capture is
    enabled and if ALSA or OSS is used (may contain more information
    in the future).
.br
.TP
.B
    \-\-no\-wm\-check
    When a 3d compositing window manager is detected the program will function as if the
    \-\-full\-shots option has been specified. This option disables that
    behavior alltogether.
.br
.TP
.B
    \-\-no\-frame
    Normally, around the recording area, there is drawn a frame to assist
    the user in identifying what does and what doesn't get captured.
    This frame will also follow around the mouse, when \-\-follow\-mouse
    is used. The frame might cause problems for drag and drop. If you do
    not wish this frame to appear, use this option.
.br
.TP
.B
    \-\-pause\-shortcut MOD+KEY
    Shortcut that will be used for pausing or unpausing the recording.
    MOD can be any combination of the following modifier keys:
    Control, Shift and Mod1 to Mod5. The modifiers can be separated 
    with any character(
.B
except SPACE
) or none at all. KEY can be any key defined in 
    /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h without the XK_ prefix.
    The list of modifiers must be separated from the key with a plus('+')
    sign.
    Default is Control+Mod1+p (Mod1 usually corresponds to left Alt).
    
.br
.TP
.B
    \-\-stop\-shortcut MOD+KEY
    Shortcut that will be used to stop the recording.
    For more, see \-pause\-shortcut above.
    Default is Control+Mod1+s. 
.br
.TP
.B
    \-\-compress\-cache
    Image data are cached with a light compression.
.br
.TP
.B
    \-\-workdir DIR
    Location where a temporary directory will be created to hold project files(default /tmp).
.br
.TP
.B
    \-\-delay n[H|h|M|m]
    Number of secs(default),minutes or hours before capture starts(number can be float).
.br
.TP
.B
    \-\-overwrite
    If there is already a file with the same name, delete it.
    Default action is to add a number postfix to the new file.
    For example when not specifying a name, if out.ogv exists,
    the new file will be out-1.ogv and if that exists too, out-2.ogv
    and so on (no ad-infinitum though, more like ad-short-integer...)
.br
.TP
.B
    \-o filename
    Name of recorded video(default out.ogv).



.PP
.br
If no other option is specified, filename can be given without the \-o switch.

.SH USAGE
.TP
.B        recordmydesktop [OPTIONS]^filename
.br
.br
.br
.br
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B
DISPLAY
.br
Display environment variable, specifying X server to connect to.
.br
.SH NOTES
.br
    Recording a window using the \-\-windowid option, doesn't track the window itself, but the region that it covers.
.br
Also when using that option the \-x,\-y,\-\-width and \-\-height options are relative to the specified window area.
.br
An easy way to find out the id of a window, is by using the
.B
xwininfo
program.
.br
Running a command like :
.br
.B
xwininfo | awk \'/Window id:/ {print $4}\'
.br
will give you only the id of the window(which should look like this: 0x4800005)
.br
More conviniently you can put all that in the command that launches recordMyDesktop like this:
.br
.B
~$recordmydesktop \-\-windowid $(xwininfo | awk \'/Window id:/ {print $4}\')
.br
.br
    Also, the lower quality you select on a video recording (
.B
-v_quality
option), the highest CPU-power that you will need.
.br
So
.B
if you are doing the encoding on the fly
,it's better to start with default values and manipulate
the end\-result with another program.
.br
.br
An excellent converter is the
.B
vlc
media player, which can perform a variety of transcoding
.br
operations, either using the graphical interface, or the commandline for more flexibility.
.br
vlc is a complex piece of software, so you should consult it's documentation, before
.br
using it.
.br
.br
An example follows, which will resize a recording named out.ogv to 512x384:
.br
.B
vlc \-I dummy out.ogv vlc:quit \-\-sout "#transcode{ vcodec = theo, width = 512, height = 384 }:duplicate{ dst = std{ access = file, mux=ogg, dst = \\"out_512x384.ogv\\" }}"
.br
.br
If you wish to change the video quality you can append the
.B
\-\-sout\-theora\-quality=n,
with
.B
n
in the range
.B
[1,10]
e.g:
.br
.B
vlc \-I dummy out.ogv vlc:quit \-\-sout "#transcode{ vcodec = theo, width = 512, height = 384 }:duplicate{ dst = std{ access = file, mux=ogg, dst = \\"out_512x384.ogv\\" }}" \-\-sout\-theora\-quality=3
.br
which will give a file of a video quality 18 (in a range of 0-63), thus appropriate for web-publishing.
.br
.br
Another option is
.B
ffmpeg2theora
, which despite its name is also a theora to theora converter.
.br
Changing the quality of a recordng with it, can be as simple as :
.br
.B
ffmpeg2theora infile.ogv \-v 3 \-a 4 \-o outfile.ogv
.br
It can even perform resizing on the size of the recording, or change the overall duration.
.br
.br
.SH BUGS
Does not record 3d windows, if \-\-full\-shots isn't specified.
.br
Saving 65536 files with the same name, will result in upredictable behavior,
.br
which might manifest as an endless loop, or a segmentation fault.
