/*VERSION 0.2.1*/
*Unupdated lines bug fixed.
*Fuzzy cursor at border bug fixed.
*Incorrect display of windows that 
extended beyond recording height fixed.
*Size adjustement that resulted in extra 
or missing pixels at borders has been corrected.
New adjustment is 8 pixels max,split evenly if possible.
*The option to drop frames has been added.
*The option to do better subsampling has been added.
*Default behavior now is to use shared memory when 
size of image gets over 75% of total (or a user set threshold).
*Many other minor bugfixes.


/*VERSION 0.2.2*/
*Changes to the configure script.
*BGR to YUV convertion corrected.

/*VERSION 0.2.3*/
*Problems on big-endian architectures, corrected 
(thanks to Marcel Unbehaun for bringing up the problem

*other minor bugfixes

/*VERSION 0.2.4*/
*Behavior on lack of $DISPLAY evironment 
variable has been corrected.
*Size adjustment is now quantized at 16 pixels, 
in order to avoid complete image distortion,
present at certain resolutions, when using shared memory
(conditional or not).
*Some other minor bugfixes, related mostly to default
values of options.

/*VERSION 0.2.5*/
*Drawing of the correct cursor is now supported through
the Xfixes extension.
