/*VERSION 0.2.1*/
*Unupdated lines bug fixed.
*Fuzzy cursor at border bug fixed.
*Incorrect display of windows that 
extended beyond recording height fixed.
*Size adjustement that resulted in extra 
or missing pixels at borders has been corrected.
New adjustment is 8 pixels max,split evenly if possible.
*The option to drop frames has been added.
*The option to do better subsampling has been added.
*Default behavior now is to use shared memory when 
size of image gets over 75% of total (or a user set threshold).
*Many other minor bugfixes.


/*VERSION 0.2.2*/
*Changes to the configure script.
*BGR to YUV convertion corrected.

/*VERSION 0.2.3*/
*Problems on big-endian architectures, corrected 
(thanks to Marcel Unbehaun for bringing up the problem
and providing the neccessary feedback to resolve it).
*Failure to respect change in channels number, while 
opening soundcard, which resulted in crashes, segfaults
and repeated error-messages has been fixed.
*other minor bugfixes

/*VERSION 0.2.4*/
*Behavior on lack of $DISPLAY evironment 
variable has been corrected.
*Size adjustment is now quantized at 16 pixels, 
in order to avoid complete image distortion,
present at certain resolutions, when using shared memory
(conditional or not).
*Some other minor bugfixes, related mostly to default
values of options.

/*VERSION 0.2.5*/
*Drawing of the correct cursor is now supported through
the Xfixes extension.
*Change of behavior on lack of any Xserver extension and 
failure to open sound device. The program now exits and informs
instead of continuing with a different configuration.
*Exit status also indicates the nature of any error that occured.
*Documentation has been updated with exit status explanations.
*Subsampling of the chroma planes is made by averaging, while 
pixel discarding is an option(used to be otherwise).


/*VERSION 0.2.6*/
*Behavior on stream desync has been changed.
Now, instead of dropping sound buffers, image
capturing speeds up. That is, waiting for timer to
expire is disabled until sync is achieved.
When not recording sound, this does not apply.
*Theora return values are now properly checked, 
to avoid inserting corrupt packages into the stream.
*Major memory leaks have been fixed. These were related
to the rectangle insertion algorithm and discarding of
used sound buffers,
*Segmentation fault on seemingly random occasions has been 
found and is now fixed. Reason was lack of thread safety over
libogg calls.

/*VERSION 0.2.7*/
*Opening of the sound device no longer hangs, if it isn't available.
Instead the program exits with the appropriate error code.
The same applies when reopening after a pause.
