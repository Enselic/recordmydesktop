To compile the program you have to go through the regular drill:

~$ gzip -d recordmydesktop-x.y.z.tar.gz
~$ tar -x recordmydesktop-x.y.z.tar
~$ cd recordmydesktop-x.y.z
~$ ./configure
~$ make
~$ sudo make install


You will need the development headers(i.e. packages ending with -dev or -devel
depending on the distribution you use) for the following:

alsa (libasound)
X
libXext
libXdamage
libXfixes
libogg
libvorbis
libtheora

Additionally you may need libICE-dev.

Last, you need the regular headers, plus the ones for pthreads
(both of which you should have if you have compiled anything else before).

Of the above, the most likely to be missing are probably those of libXdamage and libtheora
but any recent linux distribution should offer an easy way to get them.




Compiling on *BSD or other *nix flavors is not going to work(because of the alsa dependency)
but it shouldn't be too much of a hassle to change that(at least by disabling sound capture).
Future versions might include support for OSS-based sound capture.
If you are interested in this please let me know.
