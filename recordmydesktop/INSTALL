If you got this from cvs you need to have automake installed and run:

~$ cd recordmydesktop           #remeber to cd in the directory of the module
                                #you checked out
~$ sh autogen.sh
~$ ./configure
~$ make
~$ sudo make install

If you got a release tarball, to compile the program you have to go through the regular drill:

~$ gzip -d recordmydesktop-x.y.z.tar.gz
~$ tar -xvf recordmydesktop-x.y.z.tar
~$ cd recordmydesktop-x.y.z
~$ ./configure
~$ make
~$ sudo make install


You will need the development headers(i.e. packages ending with -dev or -devel
depending on the distribution you use) for the following:

alsa (libasound)
X
libICE-dev
libSM-dev
libXext
libXdamage
libXfixes
libogg
libvorbis
libtheora



Last, you need the regular headers, plus the ones for pthreads
(both of which you should have if you have compiled anything else before).

Of the above, the most likely to be missing are probably those of libXdamage and libtheora
but any recent linux distribution should offer an easy way to get them.


Compiling on *BSD or other *nix flavors is not going to work(because of the alsa dependency)
but it shouldn't be too much of a hassle to change that(at least by disabling sound capture).
Future versions might include support for OSS-based sound capture.
If you are interested in this please let me know.
