# recordMyDesktop
Official repository for recordMyDesktop. Migrated from https://sourceforge.net/projects/recordmydesktop/ for which I am the official and long-time maintainer.

# News
* 2020-12-29 After being an official but inactive maintainer for a decade, I decided to officially migrate the project from SourceForge to GitHub, since I recently was reminded that the software is still actively being used. I beieve I owe it to the original author iovar to keep the project alive, since I promised him to take over formal maintainership a long time ago.

# TODO
I just started migration. Before doing another official release, I want to
* Setup GitHub Actions to build the project in PRs
* Merge some Debian/Ubuntu patches.
* Port the old website http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php to GitHub, and redirect from the old site to the new one.
* ...more
