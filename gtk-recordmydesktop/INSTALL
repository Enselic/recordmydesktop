NOTICE:
gtk-recordMyDesktop is ONLY A FRONTEND to recordMyDesktop. You have to obtain and 
install that first.
If you don't have it look here:
http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net

DEPENDENCIES:

GNU automake >=1.5
PyGTK >= 2.4 (You will need the dev package, too)
Gnome Python Extras >= 2.11.3
recordMyDesktop 2.5

To compile the program you have to go through the regular drill:

~$ gzip -d gtk-recordMyDesktop-x.y.z.tar.gz
~$ tar -x gtk-recordMyDesktop-x.y.z.tar
~$ cd gtk-recordMyDesktop-x.y.z
~$ ./configure
~$ make
~$ sudo make install



After this you should get a menu entry under multimedia.
If you don't get one even after a logout/login from your WM
you can launch the program from a terminal like this:

~$ gtk-recordMyDesktop
