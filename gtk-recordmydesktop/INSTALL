NOTICE:
gtk-recordMyDesktop is ONLY A FRONTEND to recordMyDesktop. You have to obtain and
install that first.
If you don't have it look here:
http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net

DEPENDENCIES:

GNU automake >=1.5
Python >= 2.4
PyGTK>=2.10 or PyGTK>=2.8 with gnome-python-extras >= 2.11.3  (Be carefull since this is checked on runtime. )
recordMyDesktop 0.3.5

To compile the program you have to go through the regular drill:

~$ gzip -d gtk-recordmydesktop-x.y.z.tar.gz
~$ tar -xvf gtk-recordmydesktop-x.y.z.tar
~$ cd gtk-recordmydesktop-x.y.z
~$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/
~$ make
~$ sudo make install

The --prefix=/usr/ option might not be necessary, but it
will prevent some problems when running the program
(if you get messages about module recordMyDesktop not found,
you have to use it).


After this you should get a menu entry under multimedia.
If you don't get one even after a logout/login from your WM
you can launch the program from a terminal like this:

~$ gtk-recordMyDesktop
