        <h3>About recordMyDesktop</h3>

        <p>
            <b>recordMyDesktop</b> is a <b>desktop session recorder</b> for
            <b>GNU / linux</b> that attemps to be easy to use, yet also
            effective at it's primary task.
        </p>

        <p>
            As such, the program is separated in two parts; a simple command
            line tool that performs the basic tasks of <b>capturing and
                encoding</b> and an interface that exposes the program functionality
            in a usable way.
        </p>

        <p>
            The commandline tool (which essentially <b>is</b> recordMyDesktop),
            is written in <b>C</b>, while there are two frontends, written in
            python with <b>pyGtk</b> (gtk-recordMyDesktop) and <b>pyQt4</b>
            (qt-recordMyDesktop).
        </p>

        <p>
            recordMyDesktop <b>offers also the ability</b> to <b>record
                audio</b> through ALSA, OSS or the <a href="http://jackaudio.org/"><b>JACK audio server</b></a>
        </p>

        <p> Also, <b>recordMyDesktop produces files using only open formats.</b>
            <b>These are <a href="http://theora.org">theora for video</a> and <a
            href="http://www.vorbis.com">vorbis for audio</a>,</b> <b>using the
            <a href="http://xiph.org/ogg/">ogg container</a>.</b> (To learn more

        <h4>Project moved to GitHub</h4>
        <h5>(Tue, 29 Dec 2020 21:19:40 -0000)</h5>
        <p>After being an official but inactive maintainer for a decade, I
        decided to officially migrate the project from SourceForge to GitHub,
        since I recently was reminded that the software is still actively being
        used. I believe I owe it to the original author iovar to keep the
        project alive, since I promised him to take over formal maintainership a
        long time ago. I will gather a handful of patches, then make a new
        official release. Here is the GitHub project page: <a
        href="https://github.com/Enselic/recordmydesktop">https://github.com/Enselic/recordmydesktop</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Update on project state</h4>
        <h5>(Sun, 17 May 2009 08:03:58 -0000)</h5>
        <p>As you all can see there is not an
        awful lot of activity here, basically what has happened since I took
        over maintainership is that I have commited one or two contributed
        patches.</p> <p>Since I am currently busy working on GIMP I expect
        project management to remain in status quo for the foreseeable
        feature.</p> <p>If you have patches for rMD, send them to the mail you
        find here:<br /> <a href="http://www.chromecode.com/contact/"
        rel="nofollow">http://www.chromecode.com/contact/</a></p> <p>/

        <h4>Change of guard .</h4>
        <h5>(Wed, 14 Jan 2009 23:32:49 -0000)</h5>
        <p>This message is addressed at
        recordMyDesktop's users.</p> <p>I believe it is time for me to step down
        completely<br /> from the project and let someone else take it to new<br
        /> directions.<br /> Looking at some commit stats, it became clear that
        I<br /> haven't made any real contributions to the project since<br />
        December, 2007. After that, all I did was mostly push<br /> upstream any
        translations or patches that I got.<br /> But I haven't had a vision for
        the application for a very<br /> long time.</p> <p>It is with great joy,
        though, that I announce<br /> the new maintainer of recordMyDesktop :<br
        /> Martin Nordholts !</p> <p>Martin has approached the project a long
        time ago<br /> and has recently brought new life to the code with his<br
        /> deep re-factoring and tireless efforts to revitalise the<br /> code
        base. His level of success at improving the quality<br /> of the project
        has been astonishing and I was really happy<br /> to see that accepted
        my invitation to be the new admin and<br /> maintainer for the
        project.<br /> Whatever direction he might set for it from now on, it
        is<br /> thanks to him alone, that this project is far from dead
        yet.</p> <p>Anyway, I've learned a lot during the last (almost 3!)<br />
        years and more importantly, I've met many interesting people.<br /> The
        whole experience was really fun.</p> <p>I wish the project and its new
        maintainer best of luck !</p> <p>Cheers,<br /> John Varouhakis<br />
        (former maintainer of recordMyDesktop ;-) )</p>

        <h4>recordMyDesktop 0.3.8.1</h4>
        <h5>(Sat, 13 Dec 2008 18:07:01 -0000)</h5>
        <p>As reported by users, v0.3.8 had a bug (some headers were missing),
        that prevented<br /> recordMyDesktop to compile in some setups (RHEL4,
        Slackware 12.1 and possibly others).</p> <p>Thanks to the thorough
        feedback received, this problem should now be resolved, in v0.3.8.1.</p>

        <h4>[qt/gtk]-recordMyDesktop 0.3.8</h4>
        <h5>(Sun, 23 Nov 2008 16:00:51 -0000)</h5>
        <p>recordMyDesktop 0.3.8 is mostly a bugfixing release, driven by the
        contributions of Martin<br /> Nordholts, who is now a cotributing member
        with an SVN account . Yay!</p> <p>Here are the ChangeLogs:</p>
        <p>recordMyDesktop:<br /> * Extensive refactoring and cleanups of the
        code from Martin Nordholts.<br /> * Cursor-flickering bug has been
        fixed, by Martin.<br /> * Improved consistency on the format of the
        commandline options <br /> and updated the manpage to reflect the
        changes (also by Martin ;) ).<br /> * Applied patch by Luca Bonavita,
        that corrects the rgb<br /> to yuv algorithm and provides near perfect
        colorspace conversion<br /> (fixes bug #1961505)<br /> * Compositing
        Window managers are now recognised through the _NET_WM_CM_Sn <br /> hint
        instead of a simplistic namelist (which means that dual-mode wm's like
        <br /> kwin or yet uknown ones will be handled correctly).<br /> *
        Changed the way Jack support is offered, from dlopening at runtime to
        normal<br /> linking at compilation.<br /> * other minor changes and
        bugfixes.</p> <p>qt-recordMyDesktop:<br /> * Changed
        qt-recordMyDesktop's license to GPLV3 .<br /> * nl.po added Dutch
        translation by Jos Poortvliet<br /> * Oxygen icons are now used for
        record/pause/stop actions.<br /> * Synced to recordMyDesktop 0.3.8 (new
        format of options).</p> <p>gtk-recordMyDesktop:<br /> * nl.po added
        Dutch translation by Jos Poortvliet<br /> * Applied patch by freedo, to
        Replace GtkFileSelection with<br /> GtkFileChooserDialog.<br /> * Synced
        to recordMyDesktop 0.3.8 (new format of options).</p>
